        As a constantly evolving species we are constantly looking for ways to improve our life by creating 
        efficient and reliable technology, since we have reached a state where all data is in the palm of our 
        hands there is no excuse to have a mediocre experience accessing our bank accounts and using all the 
        features offered with absolute ease.<br /><br/>
        To paraphrase Steve Jobs, One of the important things about customer service is to provide service that the 
        customer didn’t know they wanted in the first place but once they use it they can’t go back.
        This is where Bank Decenturion comes into the painting, with the aim of providing service unmatched by 
        competitors in the market while still working with existing banks, we are an online only Bank, 
        providing customers the service behind the screen without the need to physically go to the bank.
        <br /><br />
        The purpose of this system is to provide a service to the customers to ensure their experience is seamless, 
        secure and efficient. Bank Decenturion is a new Bank with an influx of new customers with the objective 
        of being a unique community that allows people to be in complete control of their own money and security 
        as well as providing opportunities to trade and invest on our platform without having to deal with employees
        unless they absolutely have to.
